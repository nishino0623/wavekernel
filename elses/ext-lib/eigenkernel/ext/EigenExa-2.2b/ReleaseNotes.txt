  EigenExa Release Notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2b : October 30, 2014
  * Introduce new API to query the current version.
  * Introduce the constant eigen_NB=64, which refers to the block size
    for cooperative work with the ScaLAPACK routines.
  * Correct the requred array size in eigen_mat_dims().
  * Improve the performance of test matrix generator routine mat_set().
  * Add the listing option of test matrices in eigenexa_benchmark.

2.2a : June 20, 2014
  * Fix minor bug of Makefile, miscC.c and etc for BG/Q.
  * Modify the initialization process not to use invalid communicators.
  * Comment out the calling BLACS_EXIT in eigen_free().

2.2 : April 10, 2014
  * Arrange the structure of source directory.
  * Reversion of the DC routines back to version 1.3a to avoid bug.
  * Hack miscC.c to be called from IBM BG/Q.
  * Fix bug on the benchmark program for exceptional case of MPI_COMM_NULL.
  * Fix bug on eigen_s with splitted communicator.
  * Update machine depended configuration files.
  * Experimental support of building a shared library

2.1a : Feb 23, 2014
  * Fix bug on the benchmark program.

2.1 : Feb 10, 2014
  * Fix bug on eigen_sx: it gave wrong results when N=3.
  * Modify the bisect2 by a pivoting algorithm.
  * Update the test program 'eigenexa_benchmark' in order to check
    accuracy with several test matrices and computing modes.
  * Tune performance for K computer and Fujitsu FX10 platforms.
  * Add make_inc file for a BlueGeneQ platform, but it is not official
    support, just an experimental.

2.0 : Dec 13, 2013
  * Add eigen_s, which adopts the conventional 1-stage algorithm.
  * Add optional modes to compute only eigenvalues and to improve
    the accuracy of eigenvalues.

  * Tune performance for K computer and Fujitsu FX10 platforms.

1.3a : Sep 21, 2013
  * Fix bug on syncronization mechanism of eigen_trbakwyx().

1.3 : Sep 20, 2013
  * Fix bug on eigen_init() in initialization with MPI_Cart's or
    MPI_COMM_NULL's.
  * Add test programs to check several process patterns.

1.2 : Sep 17, 2013
  * Fix bug on benchmark code in making a random seed.
  * Modify to support upto 64-thread running.

1.1 : Aug 30, 2013
  * Fix bug on data-redistribution row vector to column vector
    when P=p*q and p and q have common divisor except themselves.
  * Optimize data redistribution algorithm in dc_redist[12].F

1.0 : Aug  1, 2013
  * This is the first release
  * Standard eigenvalue problem for a dense symmetric matrix by
