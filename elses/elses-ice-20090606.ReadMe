Dr. Iguchi provided a work-around for the
problem that Intel Fortran 11 failes to build
elses program.
Thank you Dr. Iguchi.

"How to apply the patch file to elses source tree"

1. Change directory to the "elses" (parent of "src").
2. Put a following command to the prompt.
patch -p6 < elses-ice-20090606.patch

The option "-p6" eliminates first 6 "/" (slash) from
the absolute path embedded in the patch file.
If this option is omitted, "patch" program ask you
a file to be patched.
